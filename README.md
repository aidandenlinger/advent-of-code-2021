# Advent of Code 2021

Doing [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) in Rust to learn and
practice the language. Given that I am new to Rust, code will be as idiomatic
as it can although I will certainly miss the mark, and these are very much non
optimal solutions.

## Usage
Each problem has its own cargo project. `cargo run` will output the solution for
that problem, and `cargo test` (for every day except day01) will run a basic
test suite, typically consisting of the example input/output given by the
website.
